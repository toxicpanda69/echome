 * Fixed-window rate limiting for the auth and chat endpoints.

 * by a read-then-write in application code. Two tabs sending at once would each
 * read the same count and each decide they were under the limit.
 *
 * Keys derived from an IP address are hashed, so this table cannot be used to
 * reconstruct who visited when. That matters more than usual for an app people
 * use to think about private things.
